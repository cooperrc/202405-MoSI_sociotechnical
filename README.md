# Incorporating socio-technical framework into engineering communications

*Ryan C. Cooper, Jorge Paricio Garcia, Stephany Santos, Desen Ozkan*

team interests

- diversity, equity, inclusion
- sociotechnical framework for engineering design
- engineering education
- technical writing 
- design

**Hypothesis**: Incorporating social and ethical conversations into engineering courses and design will create more inclusive and equity-focused courses. 

Students' bring background (family, heritage, culture, race, gender, etc.) to why decisions are important. These voices will give much-needed humanity to engineering analysis and decision making

short term goals:
- build sociotechnical case studies into ME3256: Data Driven decisions
- build framework for engineering education to consider ethical and social issues when using data, models, and other engineering tools

Possible case studies for students to practice sociotechnical communication
- pulse oximeter racial bias
- data feminism case studies

long-term goals:
- share findings with broader audience in the form of journal publications or conference talks
- build a Research Experience of Undergraduates (REU) site for "Sociotechnical engineering research"
    - reach out to faculty in College of Engineering and Human Rights that incorporate social and ethical consideration in their research
    - use REU cohort for discussions focused on sociotechnical engineering ethics and philosophy discussions

## Abstract - *WIP*

Historically, engineering courses teach "hard" scientific and mathematical concepts. Typical engineering courses focus on important concepts such as efficiency, weight, strength, durability, and other "hard" science concepts. The "soft" sciences of humanitarian, ethical, philosophical, etc. concepts are usually left outside the scope of engineering disciplines. In practice, this is because "soft" scientific concepts are extremely difficult to incorporate into engineering designs. Glaring oversight cases include racial bias in pulse oximeter readings leading to misdiagnosed black patients, ???, etc. 

Our goal in the workshop is to discuss, design, and curate case studies for engineering students to practice sociotechnical engineering during their education here at UConn. The short term goal is to build sociotechnical case studies for ME3256: Data Driven Decisions and identify challenges metrics to consider during course delivery. Longer term goals include sharing the benefits of sociotechnical engineering education with other colleagues in journal papers or conferences and submitting a NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates: Sociotechnical engineering site proposal.
